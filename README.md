## Project Overview

The **Apartment Management System** is a web-based application designed to help apartment managers (admins) and tenants manage apartments and related tasks. It provides separate dashboards for both admins and tenants, with specific features to cater to each user's role. This system simplifies various management tasks, such as managing tenants, handling apartment bookings, making rent payments, and submitting maintenance requests. 

### **Admin Features:**

The **admin** has access to a comprehensive dashboard for managing and monitoring all aspects of the apartment complex. Key features include:

- **Admin Login**: A secure login system that allows admins to access the management panel. Admins can manage tenants, apartments, and handle payments.
  
- **Admin Dashboard**: The dashboard provides an overview of the apartment system. Admins can view important metrics such as the number of tenants, the status of rent payments, upcoming apartment bookings, and pending maintenance requests.

- **Manage Apartments**: Admins can add, update, or remove apartments available for rent. They can also view the booking status of each apartment and make changes as needed.

- **Tenant Management**: Admins can view all tenants, add new tenants, edit tenant details, or remove tenants from the system. They can also track rent payments and outstanding dues.

- **View and Track Payments**: Admins can see detailed records of rent payments, including payment history for each tenant, and track upcoming payment deadlines.

- **Maintenance Requests**: Admins can view, respond to, and track maintenance requests submitted by tenants. They can mark issues as resolved and assign tasks to maintenance personnel.

- **Reports**: Admins can generate and view reports on various aspects of the apartment complex, such as rent payment status, occupancy rates, and tenant history.

### **Tenant Features:**

The **tenant** has access to a personal dashboard where they can manage their own apartment details, payment status, and make bookings. Key features include:

- **Tenant Login**: A secure login system that allows tenants to access their personal dashboard. Tenants can view their leases, make payments, and request maintenance.

- **Tenant Dashboard**: The dashboard provides an overview of the tenant’s apartment details, rent payment status, lease term, and maintenance requests. Tenants can manage their profile, submit maintenance requests, and track rent payments.

- **Make Rent Payments**: Tenants can make payments for their rent directly through the system. They can view past payment history and upcoming dues, ensuring they stay up to date on their payments.

- **Book Apartments**: Tenants can browse available apartments, view details (e.g., rent, amenities, photos), and book apartments directly from the system. Once a booking is made, the status is updated in the admin dashboard.

- **Maintenance Requests**: Tenants can submit maintenance requests directly from the dashboard. They can track the status of the requests and view when the issue has been resolved.

### **Additional Features for Both Admin and Tenant:**

- **Notifications**: Both admin and tenant will receive notifications for various activities. For example, tenants will get notifications about upcoming rent dues, while admins will be notified about new bookings or maintenance requests.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes made by either the admin or tenant (such as new payment or maintenance request submission) are updated in real-time, ensuring that both parties have the latest information.
